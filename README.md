# Building a Dungeon Crawler Game - Part 2
## [ReactU](https://www.youtube.com/c/reactuniversity) - Episode #12

This is the companion code for part two of a multipart series [found here](https://youtu.be/DyWUW7Px1MQ).

In this episode we will take everything we have learned in the past 11 episodes at ReactU and apply them to a 2d role-playing game much in the likes of the Legend of Zelda I!

We will  continue to use Redux as our store of application and component state, both by using the { connect } function of React-Redux as well as manipulating the Redux Store directly via `dispatch`. We will apply a tiling system to our map, add some tile sprites like trees and rocks, and make it so our character can't walk off the map!
